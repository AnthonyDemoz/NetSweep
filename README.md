### About

**NetSweep** is a user-friendly and powerful network scanning toolkit built in Python with a graphical interface. It supports:

- LAN scanning using ARP packets
- Remote subnet scanning using ICMP ping
- TCP port discovery with service banner grabbing
- Public IP geolocation with a Google Maps preview
- Password-protected access using bcrypt hashing

NetSweep is ideal for cybersecurity students, ethical hackers, and sysadmins who want a fast, GUI-based alternative to CLI tools.
