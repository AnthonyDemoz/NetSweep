### About

**NetSweep** is a user-friendly and powerful network scanning toolkit built in Python with a graphical interface. It supports:

- LAN scanning using Ping and Remote scanning using ARP

- Public IP geolocation
- Password-protected access using bcrypt hashing

NetSweep is ideal for cybersecurity students, ethical hackers, and sysadmins who want a fast, GUI-based alternative to CLI tools.
